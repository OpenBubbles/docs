OpenBubbles works best with Mac Hardware codes, and using only an AppleID at one time or a phone number may fix issues.**

## Common Issues

### Fixing Contacts
When you first install OpenBubbles, your contacts may not be properly displayed. In order to fix this, restart your phone.

### Issues with sending large attachments
OpenBubbles file size limit is 1 GB. Although this will vary depending on device hardware(700MB-850MB for most devices).

If the device your OpenBubbles has less RAM expect the app to fail at lower file size limits.
