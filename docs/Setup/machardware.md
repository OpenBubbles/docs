# Hardware Info
OpenBubbles **NEEDS** hardware info from genuine Apple hardware to function. OpenBubbles works **BEST** with Mac Hardware information.

## What is "Hardware Info"?
During iMessage activation, your machine's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc) are sent to Apple for validation. Because of this, OpenBubbles requires valid machine identifiers to send to Apple during activation. OpenBubbles refers to this info in the app as hardware codes.

## How can I obtain hardware info?
If you have acces to Mac, visit this site.

https://github.com/TaeHagen/Mac-Hardware-Info/releases

Once installed, you will recieve a code you can paste into OpenBubbles and a code you can scan with the OpenBubbles app for ease of use.

## What does "prevent sharing" do?

* Enabling "prevent sharing" applies a few restrictions to generated codes:
* Can only be used once (text codes only)
* Expire after 48 hours (text codes only)
* Cannot be shared to other users after completing setup.

## How do I change hardware codes?
Go to the OpenBubbles settings, then go to Reset and press "Just change hardware" and input the code manually or via qr code.
