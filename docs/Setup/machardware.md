# Hardware Info
OpenBubbles **NEEDS** hardware info from genuine Apple hardware to function. OpenBubbles works **BEST** with Mac hardware information.

## Do this first
You will also need to disable Advanced Data Protection and Contact Key Verification. There may be issues with sending and receiving if they are not turned off.

## What is "Hardware Info"?
During iMessage activation, your machine's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc.) are sent to Apple for validation. 
Because of this, OpenBubbles requires valid machine identifiers to send to Apple during activation. OpenBubbles refers to this info in the app as hardware codes.

## How can I obtain hardware info?
If you have access to Mac, visit this site.

https://github.com/TaeHagen/Mac-Hardware-Info/releases

Once installed, you will receive a code you can paste into OpenBubbles and a code you can scan with the app for ease of use.

## What does "prevent sharing" do?

* Enabling "prevent sharing" applies a few restrictions to generated codes:
* Can only be used once (text codes only)
* Expire after 48 hours (text codes only)
* Cannot be shared to other users after completing setup.

## How do I change hardware codes?
Go to the OpenBubbles settings, then go to Reset and press "Just change hardware" and input the code manually or via qr code.

## What if I do not have access to a Mac?

If you don't have access to a Mac. 
Ask a friend to share their code with you. 
They can share it from the hardware info app on the Mac, or from settings inside OpenBubbles. 
One Mac can be used by up to 20 users (20 users, not 20 logins).

## Does the Mac need to stay online?&#x20;

No! Once you have setup OpenBubbles, feel free to turn off, discard, or do anything you wish with your Mac.
You can generate more hardware codes in OpenBubbles in settings. 
Keep in mind the physical Mac may still be useful for troubleshooting.
