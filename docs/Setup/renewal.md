# Renewal/Registration System

In order for the OpenBubbles to operate, it needs to stay registered with iMessage. 
OpenBubbles does this with your device's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc.) by sending them to Apple for validation. 
OpenBubbles refers to this info in the app as "hardware info".

OpenBubbles needs to renew registrations in order to keep communicating with iMessage. 
Open settings and tap on your profile to see the next scheduled renew.

## Mac
OpenBubbles and register and renew indefinitely with no connection to the Mac. 

## iPhone
Maintaining registrtation requires the iPhone and relay to stay online. Apple can force a re-registeration at any time, therefore your iPhone must be online at all times.

Your profile page shows the next _scheduled_ re-registration.

## Debug relay issues

* Make sure your device is powered on.
* Make sure your device is connected to Wi-fi
* Change Auto-Lock to never on your device (This may lead to screen burn in, lowering brightness will help mitigate this)
