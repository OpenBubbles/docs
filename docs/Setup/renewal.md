# Renewal/Registration System

In order for the OpenBubbles to operate, it needs to communicate with iMessage. 
OpenBubbles does this with your device's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc.) and they sent to Apple for validation. 
OpenBubbles refers to this info in the app as hardware codes.
OpenBubbles needs to maintain registration using apple devices validation data in order to keep communicating with iMessage. 
Open settings and tap on your profile to see renewal times.

## Mac
The process to maintain registration when using a Mac device allows for your Mac to be turned off after initial registration. 
Apple can request your device to be reregistered at any time, when that happens OpenBubbles will handle the registration in the background with no user input needed.
So, the renewal time shown in the app when using a Mac hardware code can be safely ignored.

## iPhone
The process for maintaining registration for iPhones and phone number registration are different and Apple can request your device to be reregistered at any time.
This is the reason your device must be on and connected to Wi-Fi at all times. 

The renewal times shown in the profile section, are when OpenBubbles will renew the registration. But Apple can force one to happen at any time.

## Issues with renewing

If you have problems with renewing your registration here is what you can do.

* Check if your device is powered on.
* Check if your device is connected to Wi-fi
* Change Auto-Lock to never on your device (This may lead to screen burn in)
