# Read Receipts

If you wish to have read receipts enabled, you can do it in two ways. 

## Individually with each recipient.

* Visit the recipient you want to enable read receipts with, tap on their profile picture, and enable the "Send Read receipts" toggle.

## Via settings, this will turn it on for every recipient.

 * Go to settings, Conversation Settings, scroll down to "Interaction Settings", and enable the "Automatic Mark Read/Send Read Receipts" toggle.
