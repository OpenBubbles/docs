# Tips 

## Disable Foreground Service Notification
This notification is not needed for OpenBubbles to function.

To disable, either:
* Go to your device settings, search for notification settings for OpenBubbles, and disable the category "Foreground Service".
* Wait for a Foreground Service notification to appear, tap and hold on the notification, press the gear, and disable the category "Foreground Service".
* Go to OpenBubbles app info page, tap "Notifications" and disable the category "Foreground Service".

All the methods should end on a page like this:

## Fixing Contacts
When you first install OpenBubbles, your contacts may not be properly displayed. In order to fix this, restart your phone.
