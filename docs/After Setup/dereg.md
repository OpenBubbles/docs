# Deregistration


## What to do if you get deregistered?

To potentially resolve this issue, go to https://appleid.apple.com/, delete any duplicate devices with the same serial numbers, 2fa statuses and try again with your preferred phone number registration method.

If you receive error messages during this process, please report them to the discord (do not share any personally identifying details in public), and [report issues site](https://github.com/TaeHagen/bluebubbles-app/issues)

## What if I want to deregister?

To deregister it depends on the method that was used to register.
