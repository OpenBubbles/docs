# Registration state

## How to check registration state
Go to Settings -> Your Profile -> iMessage status


## I am deregistered, help!

To potentially resolve this issue, go to https://appleid.apple.com/, and delete any duplicate devices with the same serial numbers and try again.

Additionally, you should make sure your Apple device, the device that is registering your phone number is on, connected to Wi-Fi, and logged out of your Apple ID.

If you receive error messages during this process, please report them to the Discord (do not share any personally identifying details in public), and [report issues site](https://github.com/TaeHagen/bluebubbles-app/issues)

## What if I want to deregister?

To deregister it depends on the method that was used to register. Follow the guide that applies to your registration method.

* Mac Hardware Code - 

Go to settings -> reset -> just change hardware (if you intend to keep using OpenBubbles, with different hardware).

If you are not using OpenBubbles anymore and do not want to backup your messages tap everything. 
You also need to visit https://appleid.apple.com/ and delete the Mac that was used with OpenBubbles. 

* Relay App - 

Open the relay app, turn off relay and visit https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/
