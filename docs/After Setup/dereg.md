# Deregistration


## What to do if you get deregistered?

To potentially resolve this issue, go to https://appleid.apple.com/, delete any duplicate devices with the same serial numbers, 2fa statuses and try again with your preferred registration method.

Additionally, you should make sure your Apple device, the device that is registering your phone number is on and connected to the Wi-Fi.

If you receive error messages during this process, please report them to the discord (do not share any personally identifying details in public), and [report issues site](https://github.com/TaeHagen/bluebubbles-app/issues)

## What if I want to deregister?

To deregister it depends on the method that was used to register. Follow the guide that applies to your registration method.

* Mac Hardware Code - 

Go to settings, reset, just change hardware (if you intend to keep using OpenBubbles, with different hardware).

If you are not using OpenBubbles anymore and do not want to backup your messages tap everything. 
You also need to visit https://appleid.apple.com/ and delete the Mac that was used with OpenBubbles. 

* Simswap - 

Take the sim out, put it in your android phone and visit https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/

* Relay App - 

Open the relay app, turn off relay and visit https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/
