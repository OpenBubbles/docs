# FAQ


## What is "Hardware Info"?&#x20;

* During iMessage activation, your machine's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc) are sent to Apple for validation. Because of this, OpenBubbles requires valid machine identifiers to send to Apple during activation.

## How can I obtain hardware info?

* If you have access to a Mac. Run the [ hardware info app](https://github.com/TaeHagen/Mac-Hardware-Info/releases) on the Mac, then scan the QR code.

## Can OpenBubbles import existing messages? 
* If you have a previous OpenBubbles message backup, yes. To create a backup go to Settings,Backup & Restore,Messages Backups and press create new. Otherwise, not at this time. OpenBubbles cannot backfill messages from iCloud.

## What if I do not have access to a Mac?

* If you don't have access to a Mac. Ask a friend to share their code with you. They can share it from the hardware info app on the Mac, or from settings inside OpenBubbles. One Mac can be used by up to 20 users.

## Does the Mac need to stay online?&#x20;

* No! Once you have setup OpenBubbles, feel free to turn off, discard, or do anything you wish with your Mac. You can generate more hardware codes in OpenBubbles in settings. Keep in mind the physical Mac may still be useful for troubleshooting.

## What does "prevent sharing" do?

* Enabling "prevent sharing" applies a few restrictions to generated codes:
* Can only be used once (text codes only)
* Expire after 48 hours (text codes only)
* Cannot be shared to other users after completing setup.

## Is OpenBubbles safe to use?&#x20;

* An immense effort has been made to ensure a reliable and safe experience. That being said, iMessage is a complex and changing system, and every situation cannot be predicted. Everything happens on your phone, and anything that happens is strictly between you and Apple. Most issues will only affect OpenBubbles, and will not affect other devices or your account. In extremely rare cases, your account may be temporarily (day or two) or permanently blocked. In permanent cases, a call with Apple support will usually lift the block.

* You are responsible for who you share your hardware identifiers with. If someone uses your hardware identifiers to send mass spam, your device _will_ be blocked, and you only have yourself to blame. If you share one device with over 20 users, you may experience issues. To potentially resolve this issue go to https://appleid.apple.com/ and delete any duplicate devices with the same serial numbers and 2fa statuses and try again.

## Can I register my phone number with OpenBubbles?

* &#x20;If you have an iPhone running the relay app then, yes. The phone must stay online at all times. Enter the relay code on the hardware identifier screen, and you will be prompted to register your number. Please refer to the [Phone Number Registration](Setup/pnr) page for more information.

## Does OpenBubbles work with findmy?

* No, OpenBubbles does not have findmy integration.

## Does OpenBubbles work with facetime?

* No, OpenBubbles does not work with facetime.
